# DNA-origami-pipette-scheme

Hi, in this repository, I would like to use some MATLAB codes to facilitate the pre-stock process from manual spreadsheets into one-picture pipette scheme.
The inputs would be oligo information from IDT template (example csv files 'Plate A' and 'Plate B'.
Users are able to modify texts on the plot directly from MATLAB script. 

Try running PS_generator.m for demo.
